The first part of the coding challenge is to implement your own version of Word 
Count that counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory
named wc_input and outputs the counts to a file named wc_result.txt,which is 
placed in a directory named wc_output.

The second part of the coding challenge is to implement a method of
