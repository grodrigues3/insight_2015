Summary:

2015 Insight Data Engineering Coding Challenge

The first part of the coding challenge is to implement your own version of Word Count that counts all the words from the text files contained in a directory named wc_input and outputs the counts to a file named wc_result.txt,which is placed in a directory named wc_output.

The second part of the coding challenge is to implement a method of
easily keeping track of the median of a (streaming) list of elements being passed in.

Instructions for Running:
-----------------------------------------------

Place the text files you'd like to analyze in the wc_input directory (removing any others).

Run the python files using:
    $bash run.sh

The output files should be automatically generated and put into wc_output directory.
